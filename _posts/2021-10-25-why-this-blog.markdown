After years of enjoying the beautiful work others have done and contributed to the community it is time to give something back to all of you. The pure usage of a single blog entry has been reduced to the more specific or related topics I'm looking for and generally new technologies have a lack of new entries provided. 

Additionally I will use this blog to reflect all my learnings I've made and will make... Maybe this will help you also from time to time...

I would also love to get your feedback about my thoughts and developments to discuss this and get another point of view to it to find better solutions in the future.

The main focus will be development or generally tech related content like.

## Spring

I really appreciate the enormous work the [Spring team](https://spring.io/){:rel="nofollow"} has made to make a Java developers so much easier which gives us the opportunity to focus on the general purpose of the project. If you want to look into it I would recommend to start any of the documentation, how tos, blogs, podcasts and tutorials out there which do enormous work to provide you with all necessary infos related in any kind to help out.

If you want to be up to date about topics related to Spring I would suggest to follow the channels of Josh Long:

## DevOps

My roots are in system administration so topics like automation and infrastructure as code were always relevant and I love solutions to make this job much more easy. 

If you want to be up to date about topics related to DevOps I would suggest the [Arrested DevOps Podcast](https://www.arresteddevops.com/){:rel="nofollow"}.
